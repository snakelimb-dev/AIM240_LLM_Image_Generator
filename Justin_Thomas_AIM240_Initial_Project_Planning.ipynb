        "\n",
        "<span style=\"color:blue\">[Finetune  or place a head on a model like Qwen Vl 8B  and have it output embedding tokens for an image generator, either my own pixel art diffusion model I have already created or something like stable diffusion. Maybe learn some tricks from Meta's Chameleon model. From discussions with gemini, research examples have done this using a frozen llm, so that sounds appealing. An exciting possibility, if I could get the image output generated fast enough, could be the start of a game-like interface. A related avenue is Experimenting with feed back loops where the model outputs an image then modifies it in a painterly way. Doing this project as a clone of Instruct Pix2pix would also be great. I am referring to a text conditioned diffusionmodel that can be given an input image and text editing instructions and it will edit a portion of the input image. I would be willing to construct and even larger dataset, but perhap with more video game themed edits, or things lke player conroller input, like the d-pad. I would be willing to drop the resolution of the model to something more inline with classic video games and not more than 512x512. lastly exploring preference tuning on pix2pix or image generating llms would be interesting. I thought since companies will have model perform something like RLHF. what if I did an RLHF with one of these LLM image generators. Have a VLM judge output and express preference between image outputs. This would not be on a frozen LLM but there are many finetuning frameworks, and also preference tuning, right? ]</span>\n",

        "[Create a dataset of Godot Code using local models and commercial models in a mixture of code vetting. Would benefit learing from a curriculum which I would have to establish. I might be able to use for example the alpaca clean dataset and a english to french dataset to spice up the generation, and ask it to make a coding example based on say every method available for each node in the Godot Game engine. I could pick particular design patterns from the gang of four book, and implement those systems in Godot. Perhaps use a Rag system to retrieve other working samples so it can perform trial and error, but then maybe in the future when it uses that function it will see a proper example and use that instead. Here we consider a training lookp where the current llm generating the data only benefits from prior experience in the form of  a rag interface, presenting relevent examples. Eventually the whole corpus could then be used to fine tune an llm. ehh... but maybe it should be alway a RAG system. Shrugs. This is what benchmarks are for , right? While commercial model know some GD script , local ones certainingly need some help. It should be possible to make them do better because I feel GDscript is under represented but I can't really prove this yet.]\n",
